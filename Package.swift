        // "Starting Spring 2019, all apps submitted to the App Store that access user data will
        //  be required to include a purpose string. If you're using external libraries or SDKs,
        //  they may reference APIs that require a purpose string. While your app might not use
        //  these APIs, a purpose string is still required. You can contact the developer of the
