/**
 *  `AsyncActionConfiguration` defines general configuration for an asynchronous background action
 * that should be run in the background. Depending upon the parameters and how the action is set
 * up, this could be something that is run continuously or else is paused or reset based on a
 * timeout interval.
 *
 * The configuration is intended to be a serializable object and does not call services, record
 * data, or anything else.
 *
 * - seealso: `AsyncActionController`.
